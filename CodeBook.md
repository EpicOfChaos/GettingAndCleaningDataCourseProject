Variables
1. Subject - Numerical variable that identifies which subject performed the activity. There were 30 participants, therefore the possible values is between 1 and 30.
2. Activity - Categorical variable describing the activity that was performed by the subject possible values are "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING".
3. MeanTriaxialVelocity - Numerical value that is the summarized mean of the Triaxial Velocity by subject and activity.
4. MeanStandardDeviationTriaxialVelocity - Numerical value that is the summarized mean of the standard deviation of the Triaxial Velocity by subject and activity.
